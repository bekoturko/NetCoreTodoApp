## Asp.Net Core Todo Web Application
ASP.NET Core 5.0 Web Application

We have a basic Software Engineer Challenge Project. 
Our Software Engineer Challenge Project is a TO-DO app. It is like Wunderlist and Todoist. We expect 
you to develop the backend for a simple to-do app with accompanying unit tests. 
In the application, users should be able to register and create their own to-do lists.
